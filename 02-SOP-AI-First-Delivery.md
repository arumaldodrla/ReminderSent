_# 02. SOP for 100% AI-Driven Delivery

**Owner:** Manus AI
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-26
**Version:** 2.0

**Purpose:** This document defines the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the end-to-end, **100% AI-driven development, deployment, and maintenance** of the ReminderSend platform. This is a non-negotiable protocol. Human intervention is limited to strategic guidance and final approval for major releases.

---

## 1. The Autonomous Development Lifecycle

The development process is a fully autonomous, closed loop managed by AI agents. Human interaction is asynchronous and occurs outside the core loop.

    B --> C[1. Decompose into tasks & create tickets];
    C --> D{**Development Agent**};
    D --> E[2. Write code, tests, and docs];
    E --> F[3. Create Pull Request];
    F --> G{**CI Pipeline**<br>(Lint, Test, Build, Security Scan)};
    G -- Pass --> H{**Review Agent**};
    H -- Approve --> I[4. Auto-Merge to `main`];
    I --> J[5. Auto-Deploy to Staging];
    J --> K{**QA Agent**};
    K --> L[6. Run E2E tests on Staging];
    L -- Pass --> M{**Human Oversight**<br>(Major Releases Only)};
    M -- Approve --> N[7. Promote to Production];
    N --> O{**Monitoring Agent**};
    O -- Detects Anomaly --> P[8. Create new ticket];
    P --> D;
```

## 2. Prompting Protocols

All development tasks are initiated through the prompts defined in `Google-Antigravity-AI-Prompts.md`. Agents MUST adhere to these protocols:

*   **System Context:** Every new session MUST begin with the "System Context" prompt to ensure the AI agent has the full technical and business context.
*   **Specificity:** Prompts MUST be specific and include all required sections (e.g., "Deliverables Required," "Acceptance Criteria").
*   **One Task, One Prompt:** Each prompt should correspond to a single, well-defined task (e.g., create one component, implement one endpoint).

## 3. Branching and PR Strategy

A `main` branch strategy is used, with all feature development occurring in short-lived feature branches.

*   **Branch Naming:** Branches MUST be named `feature/<ticket-id>-<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/RS-101-create-reminder-form`).
*   **Pull Requests (PRs):**
    *   A PR is created when a feature is complete and all tests are passing.
    *   The PR description MUST be auto-generated by the AI agent and include a summary of changes, testing evidence, and a link to the corresponding user story.
    *   At least one other AI agent MUST review and approve the PR.
    *   The PR is automatically merged into `main` upon approval.

## 4. Definition of Done (DoD)

A feature is considered "Done" only when it meets all of the following criteria:

*   All code is merged into the `main` branch.
*   All unit, integration, and E2E tests are passing in the CI/CD pipeline.
*   Test coverage is >80%.
*   All acceptance criteria from the user story are met.
*   The feature has been deployed to the staging environment and verified.
*   All relevant documentation (`01-PRD.md`, `03-System-Architecture.md`, etc.) has been updated to reflect the changes.

## 5. Release and Incident Management

*   **Release Process:**
    1.  **Staging:** All merges to `main` are **automatically** deployed to the staging environment.
    2.  **Production:** For minor releases (see *16-Autonomous-Maintenance.md*), promotion to production is automatic. For major releases, a human with designated authority must provide explicit approval via a GitHub Action trigger comment on the commit.
*   **Rollback:** If a critical issue is detected post-deployment, Vercel's instant rollback feature will be used to revert to the previous stable deployment.
*   **Incident Handling:**
    1.  **Detection:** Sentry or Datadog automatically creates an incident.
    2.  **Triage:** An AI agent analyzes the incident to determine the root cause.
    3.  **Resolution:** The agent attempts to generate a hotfix. If successful, the fix is deployed following the standard release process. If not, the incident is escalated to Zoho Desk for human review.

## 6. Documentation Update Policy

Documentation is as critical as code. It MUST be updated in lockstep with every change.

*   **Co-location:** Documentation updates MUST be included in the same PR as the code changes they describe.
*   **Verification:** The Definition of Done includes a check to ensure all relevant documentation has been updated.
*   **AI Responsibility:** The AI agent responsible for the code change is also responsible for updating the documentation.

## Implementation Notes for AI Agents

*   **Automate Everything:** Your primary directive is to automate this entire SOP. Create scripts and workflows to manage branching, PRs, deployments, and monitoring.
*   **Prompt Adherence:** Strictly follow the prompting library. Do not deviate or attempt to use free-form prompts for development tasks.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A feature branch can be created, developed on, and merged into `main` following the defined process.
    *   A release can be successfully deployed to staging and then promoted to production.
    *   An automated incident alert in Sentry triggers the AI triage process.
